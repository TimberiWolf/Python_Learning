The terminal does not "end" the input from a single device unless it "ends" the input from one device. In UNIX and amigados, the process of translating keystrokes into EOF is completed by the terminal driver, so the application does not need to distinguish the terminal from other input files. UNIX platform driver transmits a transfer end character (Control-D, ASCII code is 04) at the beginning of the line to indicate the end of the file. In amigados, the driver passes a control - \ \ to indicate the end of the file (Control-D is used as the interrupt character). To insert a real Control-D character into the input stream, the user needs to precede it with a "reference" command character (usually control-v, which means that the next character is not used as a control character, but is used literally).
